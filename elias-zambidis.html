          <p>Dr. Elias Zambidis is an Associate Professor of Oncology and Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. 
                Dr. Zambidis specializes in Pediatric Oncology and Pediatric Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation in the Dept of Oncology, Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, and is the Principal Investigator of a laboratory in the Stem Cell Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering.
                <br> <br> Dr. Zambidis earned his M.D./Ph.D. in the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y.
                He completed his Pediatrics Residency in the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, and his clinical/research fellowships in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Cancer Institute at the NIH. 
                <br> <br> His clinical expertise is in the treatment of  disorders of the immune system, histiocytic disorders, hematologic malignancies, blood and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and regenerative medicine. 
                Dr. Zambidis has been interested in the developmental biology of human vascular, hematopoietic, and pluripotent stem cells since beginning his Pediatric Hematology/Oncology fellowship at Johns Hopkins.
                As a fellow, he was one of the very first investigators at Johns Hopkins to work with IVF embryo-derived human embryonic stem cells (hESC), and began working with them immediately after the federal government made them available to the biomedical community in 2002.
                He has personally trained over 40 investigators and collaborators at Johns Hopkins in the propagation and differentiation of hESC. 
                <br> <br> The Zambidis Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering focuses on understanding the developmental biology of human hemato-vascular and human pluripotent stem cells. 
                His group has developed novel hiPSC-based vascular therapies, and more recently derived a new class of human pluripotent stem  cells in a na√Øve ground state with new functionalities. 
                As a BMT physician-scientist, his ultimate goal is to use hESC, hiPSC, and related pluripotent stem cell technologies to not only treat severe hematologic and vascular diseases, but also to elucidate the biological nature of cancer and ageing.
